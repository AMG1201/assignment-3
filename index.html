                    <p> The technological world has developed and has continued to
                        innovate to provide an easier lifestyle. This is the main focus of
                        Automation. 
                        Automation has gained more recognition from people in the business
                        and also in industrial sectors. The purpose of this topic is to
                        discuss and inform the overview knowledge in the automation field
                        particularly in Service Automation.
                        This topic is relevant in our society nowadays, because everything
                        is moving towards the new and modern technology.​
                        The world is becoming more mechanized which affects many people's livelihoods
                        and jobs are being replaced by machines.​ It will also affect our
                        future prospects in getting a job and the number of unemployment
                        will continuously increase.​

                <p> <b> THE EFFECTS OF MODERN TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION IN POEPLE AND IN THEIR WORKPLACE </b> </p>
                <p> The main focus of our investigation is to find how automation has affected the service industry in particular.
                    The service industry is an industry that is a part of the economy which creates services for people rather
                    than creating a tangible object.All businesses that create and offer services fall under the service industry,
                    services such as banking, retail trade and even professional services such as computer software development
                    are just a few examples.(Service industry) “Automation is a term for technology applications where human
                    input is minimized. This includes business process automation (BPA), IT automation, personal applications
                    such as home automation and more.”(What is automation?). </p>

                    <p> The main purpose of Automation is to apply technology to minimize human input.
                        An example of a business in the service industry which has implemented automation into their business would be uber.
                        Uber provides transport and deliveries. It's an automated version of taxis and food deliveries,
                        it has eliminated the need to phone someone or be in the right area to get a taxi, as well as being
                        able to get food without having to go to the actual restraunts within just a few taps of buttons.
                        As automation continues to evolve and be implemented into businesses, it helps people carry out
                        certain tasks much more effortlessly such as organizing a ride. Automation is a weird and controversial
                        topic as it can sometimes be contradicting. While automation can create jobs, it also takes jobs away as
                        automation can replace tasks that otherwise may have been carried out by humans. Because of this there has
                        been some backlash against it. This is first seen in the first industrial revolution where machines such as
                        manufacturing machines, machine tools and steam engines as well as the rise of textile machines.</p>

                    <p>  In 1810 in the british textile industry during the first industrial revolution, new technology was implemented which took away wages and jobs,
                        in outrage a movement called luddites arose which smashed machines across these factories. As protests continued and violence increased,
                        punishments were dished out whether it was being hanged, sent to prison or shipped to australia. (aecker, Computers and society: Modern perspectives 2019).
                        As shown, automation has always had a bright past. While there are some negatives there are many opportunities that it provides such as search engines,
                        creation of jobs just to name a few. As we society continues to advance with technology there will be many more implementations of automation which will
                        create many business opportunities in the future. We hope that our website can inform you on this topic and give you understanding about the effects of automation. </p>

                <p style="color:#18C7DE;font-family:Impact;font-size:larger;text-align:left;"> <b> <u> OPPORTUNITES </u></b> </p> <br>
                <p> <b> WHAT ARE THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOCIETY REGARDING SERVICE AUTOMATION? </b> </p>
                <p> The world is becoming more and more automated as the years go on. According to Forbes, a survey done by Deloitte,
                    half of the people that were surveyed said that their organization is “deeply involved in automation projects,
                    with 24% using AI and robotics to perform routine tasks” (Arka Dhar, 2019). This is where automation in service
                    industries opens up a lot of opportunities. There are many opportunities that service automation opens up in travel,
                    tourism and hospitality companies. In hotels employee jobs such as checking in to the hotel are taken over by service
                    automation. Employee front desk jobs are taken over regarding check ins by mobile apps and other software which make
                    it easier for customers staying at the hotel to have a contactless, fast check in (MGM Resorts International, 2017).
                    Other services are now inclining more and more towards robotics. The hotel Henn-na, is the first fully robotically
                    automated hotel which replaces front desk workers, their front desk is operated by 3 robots. Other services are also
                    robotically automated such as robotic vacuum cleaners, and even a robotic arm that operates the luggage storage room
                    (http://www.h-n-h.jp/en/) to achieve “ultimate efficiency”. Other industries are also moving towards automated service.</p>

                <p> Many restaurants, especially sushi restaurants, are implementing conveyor belts to get their food to their customers
                    who are sitting outside it (Ngai, Suk, & Lo, 2008). This makes it easier for workers to serve their customers without
                    leaving their workstation, cutting down on time. This can also be a unique selling point (UPS) for a business where
                    they can possibly sell their food for a slightly higher price using the conveyor belt as a UPS. In the flights and
                    travel industry service automation has been significantly implemented to cut down the travel time in airports as well
                    as cutting down costs of labor. For example in 2016 Auckland has implemented their first check in kiosk to prepare for 
                    the high volume of travelers during the summer holidays. Auckland airport has invested in 45 of these Kiosk Self check-in
                    machines where customers are able to check in, print their ticket, get the tags for their bags and drop it off (Gez Johns, 2016).
                    Furthermore the opportunities for service automation at airports continue to increase, we see this where the luggage of the
                    passengers are taken directly to the airplane without a middleman to carry the luggage to the airplane or a vehicle to tug it to the airplane.
                    There is then a worker in the belly of the plane sorting and ready to store it. A regular belt loader can be extended with the Rollertrack Conveyor.
                    It reaches into the bulk hold of the aircraft, turns 90 degrees, and delivers bags to the ramp agent in the cargo hold promptly and reliably. </p>

                <p> The Rollertrack Conveyor system allows airport ground handlers to load and unload large baggage and freight more quickly and effectively,
                    while also minimizing physical strain on the employees (https://powerstow.com/rollertrack-conveyor/). There are other industries
                    where the opportunity for service automation is very limited as physical machines are not yet implemented in industries like tourism and travel agencies.
                    For example in the tourism industry there is a voiceover automation when visiting tourist sites rather than a worker being physically there.
                    But this cannot always be automated by machines as some tourism areas require workers to be there. For example tourist sites which are natural
                    and robotics and machinery cannot be accessed i.e Glow worm caves. Other industries such as travel agencies are automated using third party
                    hosts such as the internet, google etc. There are no physical machines at the travel agencies tending to customers rather a website online.
                    Although it is partially automated it is not fully automated and it does take some human resources to then complete the service.
                    Automated services through AI can't always be implemented in every service and every stage of sales, eventually it does require human resources
                    to fully implement those services. Advanced robotic technology paired with human resources and human interaction is the best option
                    for automating services in the future. </p>

                <p> Automation can be very useful and helpful in today’s modern day society.
                    It can help people accomplished everyday tasks at a faster rate and accomplish those tasks easier.
                    However, despite how helpful Automation can be, it also has negative effects on people and also in our society. </p>

                <p> <b> NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SERVICE AUTOMATION </b> </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Job Obsolescence and Unemployment </u> </b> <br>
                    With the rise of globalization and advancements in technology, many companies have switched to automation to remain competitive.
                    Millions of jobs have been lost to automation and machines are taking people’s job. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> High Cost of Invest in Automation </u> </b> <br>
                    An automated system may cost thousands to millions of dollars to outline, build, and install.
                    Some automated tools necessitate more maintenance than traditional machinery.
                    As a result, small manufacturing companies may be hesitant to invest in an automated solution
                    when they already have machinery that works. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Limited Capacity of Machines </u> </b> <br>
                    Though machinery is less prone to human error for some processes, there is a downside to using technology in place of a person.
                    A person can think critically, respond more flexibly to situations, and use creativity to solve problems. A machine is limited
                    by pre-programmed inputs and is less able to solve complex situations. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Security Concerns </u> </b> <br>
                    In a data-driven world, businesses are harnessing valuable information to attract new customers, increase sales, and improve productivity.
                    Managing thousands of paper documents, receipts, and transactions is just as susceptible to theft and fraud.
                    Businesses are forced to rely on locks and security measures to protect valuable records and financial information’s. </p>

                <p> <b> POSITIVE EFFECTS OF SERVICE AUTOMATION </b> </p>
                <p> <b> <u> Reduction of Repetitive Tasks </u> </b> <br>
                    The repetition of daily tasks is common when the work processes are manual. When the service automation system is implemented,
                    the tasks are delegated to the machines, therefore the employees can focus on strategic activities for the business. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Reduce Human Errors </u> </b> <br>
                    When people do mundane tasks over and over, errors are bound to happen but with service automation,
                    you can easily integrate your existing processes and data into a secured dashboard. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Increase Operational Efficiency </u> </b> <br>
                    Service automation streamlines processes, opening the door for time and cost savings in many ways by  automating
                    routine tasks and creating more efficient workflows, facilities managers can focus on those tasks that truly need attention,
                    directly impacting the operational effectiveness of the team. </p>

                 <p> <b> <u> Improve Customer Satisfaction </u> </b> <br>
                    Service automation allows easier communication between facilities staff which translates to happier customers.
                    It ensures that work is done in a high-quality and timely manner and customers don’t
                    experience any interruptions that would affect their in-store experience. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> GIANNI MCLEAY - 20149279 </u> </b> </p>
                <p> Automation can be quite a controversial topic; it contains both positives and negatives and there is no clear morally
                    right point of view on the topic when arguing for and against it. An example of this is automation when it comes to monitoring employees'
                    job performance. For businesses to reach their goals and be profitable, they need to ensure that their employees are on track with their work.
                    While there is nothing wrong with keeping track of an employee's job performance, through the use of extensive observation with the use of automation
                    it can have quite a negative effect. With the use of digital techniques, management can monitor all use of time including inefficient and time-wasting
                    behavior such as social media. According to (Baecker, Computers and society: Modern perspectives 2019), a study showed that organizations that used
                    computerized monitoring increased organization control, productivity, and assessment of employee performance. But it also increased stress levels
                    and employees had a higher job dissatisfaction compared to organizations that did not use computerized monitoring.
                    (Baecker, Computers and society: Modern perspectives 2019).
                    “The more employers relied upon CPM data to judge job performance; the more dissatisfied employees were with evaluation.
                    Employee stress increased with the degree to which job task monitoring results were reported to them”
                    (Baecker, Computers and society: Modern perspectives 2019). So, while Automation allows businesses to monitor employees more
                    which has shown its benefits to the business, it harms the employees more. </p>
                    
                <p> In more recent times, particularly in the service industry where delivery is involved. It has shown that by 2013, 37% of companies
                    have tracked the location of employees as well as allowing management to eavesdrop on workers interactions through the use of badges
                    (Baecker, Computers and society: Modern perspectives 2019 seems as if they are treating
                    them like they are second-class citizens. “A study showed at the Bank of America where over 3000 employees worked, with the use of badges as well
                    as other changes where workers within a team would have breaks at the same time leading to more interaction and engagement between co-workers
                    resulted in a $15 million a year increase in productivity” (Baecker, Computers and society: Modern perspectives 2019).
                    While implementing automation into monitoring job performance is one example in the whole topic, I think it's a good example as it shows how automation has its pros and cons.
                    With the use of implementing a computerized monitoring system, it showed it would increase productivity but at the same time there's a correlation with increased stress,
                    health problems and job dissatisfaction. But when management involves other changes alongside computerized monitoring it has shown to have a positive effect on the
                    business productivity wise as well as an increase in more interaction between workers. </p>
                    
                <p> The use of automation needs to be paired with changes from people as well.
                    In this example, management of businesses need to implement changes if they are going to use computerized monitoring. I think this goes for automation in general,
                    while it has its benefits it also has negatives but when used the correct way it can help improve societies and its needs.
                    Another example where automation has pros and cons is with jobs.
                    According to (36+ Alarming Automation & Job Loss Statistics [2022]: Are robots, machines, and Ai coming for your job?.) “Since 2000, at least 260,000
                    jobs have been lost in the US to automation”. But as shown with uber there have been 3.9 million jobs created which is an app that heavily uses automation
                    (Helling et al., How many uber drivers are there in 2022? 2022). It is incredibly sad that people have lost jobs to automation, it also created many opportunities
                    for other people as well. In my opinion the pros outweigh the cons. From the research I have done,
                    automation is helpful for society and is necessary for society to continue to grow and evolve. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> AYA MENDOZA - 20094939 </u> </b> </p>
                <p> Our topic is all about the Effects of Modern Technology and Automation in People and in their Workplace.
                    As companies embrace the advance technology and automation, some jobs will be created or enhanced,
                    but many more are likely to go away and because of this ethical issues will occur.
                    One of the ethical issues that this topic is facing right now is job obsolescence and unemployment.
                    This is a fear pervading almost every industry, from customer service, to admin, to more creative roles.
                    As automation becomes more proficient, people worry about more jobs being taken over.
                    It’s argued, for this reason, that automation causes harm to both people and society. </p>

                <p> One of the reasons workers are thinking about is the automation anxiety. This is the unclear nature
                    and initial unrest of automation. It can quickly cause a panic-induced dip in morale and it can be
                    both unsettling and stressful if the workers don’t handle the service automation carefully and this
                    stress can lead to extra harm unless the fears are addressed. For me, the best way to deal with this
                    potential ethical hazard is to keep the real purpose of automation in every industry.
                    Reassuring the employees that the automation they have is there to help them, not to replace them.
                    As a result of this, it will have a clarity, it will help reducing the workplace anxiety and it will
                    also reduce the ethical concerns surrounding employees mental welfare. </p>

                <p> Another reason that automation can be ethical is the fear of having fewer jobs in the future because
                    automation is getting more and more capable across multiple disciplines, automation might take jobs,
                    there could be even more  jobless people out there who will struggle to put food on their table and
                    feeling useless to the society. Certainly, if automation does lead to job loss without any kind of
                    alternate income provided, this will create a huge ethical issue not only affects individuals but
                    threatens to harm the society as a whole. </p>
                
                <p> However, it’s not the automation itself that is the potential cause of this ethical issue, but the way industries use it.
                    The creation of business process automation is completely ethical and the goal of this is to improve working life for
                    thousands of people across the world. But, automation becomes unethical when you use it incorrectly or in an unethical way.
                    Fortunately, this means that those ethical issues around automation become fully avoidable. </p>
