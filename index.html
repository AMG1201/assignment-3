                <p> Automation can be very useful and helpful in today’s modern day society.
                    It can help people accomplished everyday tasks at a faster rate and accomplish those tasks easier.
                    However, despite how helpful Automation can be, it also has negative effects on people and also in our society. </p>

                <p> <b> NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF SERVICE AUTOMATION </b> </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Job Obsolescence and Unemployment </u> </b> <br>
                    With the rise of globalization and advancements in technology, many companies have switched to automation to remain competitive.
                    Millions of jobs have been lost to automation and machines are taking people’s job. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> High Cost of Invest in Automation </u> </b> <br>
                    An automated system may cost thousands to millions of dollars to outline, build, and install.
                    Some automated tools necessitate more maintenance than traditional machinery.
                    As a result, small manufacturing companies may be hesitant to invest in an automated solution
                    when they already have machinery that works. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Limited Capacity of Machines </u> </b> <br>
                    Though machinery is less prone to human error for some processes, there is a downside to using technology in place of a person.
                    A person can think critically, respond more flexibly to situations, and use creativity to solve problems. A machine is limited
                    by pre-programmed inputs and is less able to solve complex situations. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Security Concerns </u> </b> <br>
                    In a data-driven world, businesses are harnessing valuable information to attract new customers, increase sales, and improve productivity.
                    Managing thousands of paper documents, receipts, and transactions is just as susceptible to theft and fraud.
                    Businesses are forced to rely on locks and security measures to protect valuable records and financial information’s. </p>

                <p> <b> POSITIVE EFFECTS OF SERVICE AUTOMATION </b> </p>
                <p> <b> <u> Reduction of Repetitive Tasks </u> </b> <br>
                    The repetition of daily tasks is common when the work processes are manual. When the service automation system is implemented,
                    the tasks are delegated to the machines, therefore the employees can focus on strategic activities for the business. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Reduce Human Errors </u> </b> <br>
                    When people do mundane tasks over and over, errors are bound to happen but with service automation,
                    you can easily integrate your existing processes and data into a secured dashboard. </p>

                <p> <b> <u> Increase Operational Efficiency </u> </b> <br>
                    Service automation streamlines processes, opening the door for time and cost savings in many ways by  automating
                    routine tasks and creating more efficient workflows, facilities managers can focus on those tasks that truly need attention,
                    directly impacting the operational effectiveness of the team. </p>

                 <p> <b> <u> Improve Customer Satisfaction </u> </b> <br>
                    Service automation allows easier communication between facilities staff which translates to happier customers.
                    It ensures that work is done in a high-quality and timely manner and customers don’t
                    experience any interruptions that would affect their in-store experience. </p>
